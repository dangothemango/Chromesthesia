As I was playing 140 while tripping, besides truly experiencing flow, the main effect I noticed was how the sounds(music), art style, and gameplay all came together to form it's own medium. That's right, your game seemed to transcend the medium of videogames itself -  as if it were not a videogame or 'interactive experience', rather a sole, unnamed new entity. Yes, I am aware of how stupidly-romanticized this sounds, yet the experience gave me an idea- the idea to attempt to 'transcend this medium' with a new kind of game- a game in which the art, interactivity, and music would all be essential to making sense of one another. 

 I would like to have the 'combat' of the enemies feel like dancing. For example, for a certain melody in the song, the 'enemies' would circle around the player and on every 3rd beat  a lazer would be shot. Inductive reasoning and exploration used in games like the 3D Zelda and Metroid games would be employed in the game design.  I would want the player to have choice in the  'combat'  with different 'combos'  (similar to DMC's or Bayonetta's combat style). However, I would want this game to be kept abstract, and not feel like a game. The pace of the game would coincide with the speed or feelings of the music. The combat wouldn't actually feel or look like combat, the entire game is intended to mimic the feeling of synesthesia. All aspects of the game should work with one another and be essential to understanding one another. 

We're making the game in Unity, the game would have full 3D movement similar to a 3D Super Mario game, fluid platforming similar to Rayman Legends(in 3D), 'combat' that allows players to come up with their own methods for 'beating enemies'(similar to the combat mechanics of DMC or Bayonetta), and puzzles using inductive reasoning similar to one's found in Zelda. Obviously this is way too much to do at first, which is why we'd focus on the platforming and making the player fun to control first, from there, we would move on to 'combat' , and then inductive reasoning based puzzles.

However, I don't want to make the gameplay's focus on exact timing and precision with the rhythm, but I would want to use the music as an essential tool to guide and hint the player to the solution. 
We plan to use these types of music for our gameplay:
-acoustic music
-fast paced drum and base 
-folk  
-house
- piano jazz/ fusion jazz (would have some recognizable tune and rhythm with unpredictable improvisation )
- rock
- SoundCloud electronic music (this is what I call the un-categorizable electronic music of SoundCloud)





ideas for combat:
different enemies that fire or attack at different beats or tempos. For example, an enemy that circles around every 5 bars. Timing the enemies so that they run with the music. Every time the music is changed, they run in a different path. They have 3 logical states of movement, chase, defend/flee, group up with your teammates and ‘strategize’. Good combat for this game should feel like dancing- figuring out the optimal way surpass the enemy’s pattern and then unleashing an attack

Intro to my idea for a music rhythm based platformer(only the environment and enemies would be affected by the music):
Look up 140!! and no I don't want to recreate 140, I want to create an actual platformer(like sonic or mario or rayman legends or megaman x) which isn’t as minimalist as 140 and has an environment which is heavily influenced by the music, rhythm and sound. Each checkpoint will add another layer to the music(musical progression)- adding more complexity as the level goes on.

IMPORTANT, HOW TO GET THE TIMING RIGHT:
don't use delta time use get time or something to sync the actions with the sounds
store time in the starting function, when you play the sound, it will return a variable. This will make it easy to time shit in the environment properly with effects.
player abilities:
wallkicking
sprinting
platforms waving in sync  with the beat
platforms disappearing and reappearing with the beat


walls that vertically crush into each other
some enemies you’ll have to shoot(indicated by another color, then it changes color and you have to melee it)
some enemies youll have to jump on
scripted bouncepads, ones that allow for free movement 
free-from bouncepads ones that just launch you up
give player hover ability
boost ability
melee attack
shooting attack



enemies:
diff types of enemies that move with the beat
enemies that slide underneath you with a flame ring
batman arkham asylum counter to the beat


Extra notes to focus on after the core mechanics have developed:
The music will; heavily affect the environment
and players will be forced to execute precise maneuvers with numerous checkpoints
have a bullet system that bounces off one another
homing missile style bullets 
melee style attacks
acceleration based platforming- the faster you go, the faster the music shall be
you hit it with one weapon and it then changes color, indicating that you have to use a different weapon

Weird technical notes that we probably can ignore:
read this only if you know how to work with midis, if not, we'll just use an mp3 and time things spawning over it. We have to make sure the programming is efficient to avoid any lag cuz this would fuck up the timing of everything.
one can use midis to trigger an action in the game once the sound plays. Software to do this includes:
Synthesia 
Finaly note pad 

However, to make the sound high-quality and not 8-bit you would have to bring in your own sound font 


Reward player for pressing controls in time with the music

Axel’s thing
Bard game
where you go around and the music changes based on where you are
and you can take a snapshot of your current location's music and stuff
and then you go to villages and you can play back the snapshots for them


Questions:
Is this platformer 3d? 2.5d? 2d?
What does combat look like?
Are there weapons?
Who are your enemies?
Why are they your enemies?
How involved/complicated should combat be?
What is <main character(s)> motivation?
What is the environment like?
Gloomy? Bright?
How is this affected by music

Common pitfalls to consider:
Quick time events...don't do them.
Focus on rewarding the player for following the music rather than punishing them for not.
Tell a story. Give players a reason to play, more than a gimmick

Notes:

Ideas:
Being able to switch song elements (coroutines) on and off.
Enemies take more damage when hit on the beat.
